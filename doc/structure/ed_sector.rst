Quantum Numbers Sectors
============================

This is a fundamental part of the code where the symmetry sectors are
constructed.
Together with that all the  procedures required by Fock space
constructions are defined here. 


.. f:automodule::   ed_sector
   :members: build_sector, delete_sector
