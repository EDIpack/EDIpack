Hamiltonian Direct :math:`H\times\vec{v}`
==============================================

In the module :f:mod:`ed_hamiltonian_normal_direct_hxv` we implement
different functions according to the value of the variable
:f:var:`ed_total_ud`, which distinguish between conservation of total
or orbital resolved spin occupations and the serial or parallel case.
